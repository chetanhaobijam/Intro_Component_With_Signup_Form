## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (for Form Validations)
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learned more about SCSS and this time I get to know how the Javascript Form Validation works. We can use to validate our forms instead of using the HTML 'required' attribute. I also get to know how we can manipulate the HTML Elements by using JS DOM methods.

### Continued development

I still have lots to learn about Frontend Development. I still need to do more projects to be a better Developer in the future. And since I have surpassed the 'Novice' Level I think that I can now take on 'Junior' Level Projects. Looking forward for next project.
